# Nokia Keypad Converter Website

This is a simple single-page website that converts input between old Nokia phone keypad numbers and letters, and vice versa.

## Features

- Convert letters to the corresponding number sequences.
- Responsive and modern UI using Tailwind CSS.
- Uses Google Fonts for clean typography.
- Conversion logic implemented in JavaScript.
- Easy to use with toggle buttons to switch conversion direction.

## How to Use

1. Open the `index.html` file in any modern web browser.
2. Enter your input in the text area:
   - For number to letter conversion, input sequences like `2 22 222`.
   - For letter to number conversion, input letters like `abc`.
3. Click the "Numbers to Letters" or "Letters to Numbers" button to perform the conversion.
4. The converted output will appear in the output text area.
